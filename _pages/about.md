Jooyeon Jamie Im is a Ph.D. student in the CCS lab (Sep 2022 - Present). She received her B.A. in psychology from Boston University and M.S. & Ph.D. in neuroscience from Seoul National University. She worked as a postdoctoral fellow from Feb 2021 to Aug 2022 in the CCS Lab and decided to pursue her second Ph.D. in clinical psychology. Previously, her research focused on investigating the neurobiological mechanisms of psychiatric and neurologic disorders using neuroimaging and noninvasive brain stimulation methods. More recently, she became interested in the impact of social relationships on the brain and mental health and particularly what aspects of social relationships and social cognition can be identified as transdiagnostic factors of mental disorders. Currently, she is integrating neuroimaging and social network analysis to examine the role of social network characteristics on smoking cessation outcomes among treatment-seeking smokers as well as to evaluate social cognition and social network characteristics as predictors of conversion to Alzheimerâ€™s disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment.
